# feature-extraction-and-matching
This project demonstrates how to detect and locate a specific object within a target image using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), FLANN-based feature matching, and Homography transformation. The result is a bounding polygon drawn on the target image, highlighting the detected object.
